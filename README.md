# Password Generator Week 3 Homework

## Description

The goal of this homework assignment was to create a password generator. The generator operates after clicking a button that creates a randomly generated password to meet a criteria input by the user. Creating the generator tested my knowledge of JavaScript functions, methods, and traversing the DOM. This assignment also allowed me to experiment with manipulating the HTML using JavaScript.

## Tasks Completed

- WHEN clicking on the button to generate a password, THEN you are presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
- WHEN prompted for password criteria, THEN you select which criteria to include in the password
- WHEN prompted for the length of the password, THEN you choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
- WHEN asked for character types to include in the password, THEN you confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
- WHEN you answer each prompt, THEN your input will be validated and at least one character type will be selected
- WHEN all prompts are answered, THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
- WHEN the password is generated, THEN the password is  written to the page
